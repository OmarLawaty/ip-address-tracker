## Getting started

### GeoIpify API

#### How to get key

To use the IP Geolocation API by IPify, you'll need to sign up for a free account. You won't need to add any cards details to do this and it's a very quick process. This will generate an API Key for you. Usually, you would be able to restrict your API Key to a specific URL (your domain). This makes sure that other people can't use your API Key on their websites. IPify doesn't have this feature, but because you aren't adding your card details, this isn't an issue. **So be sure to only sign up for the free account and DO NOT enter any card details**.

#### Where to use the key

To use the Key you got from GeoIpify , Go to [key.js](../src/api/Key.js) and replace the `null` value with the key you just got.

### Start the project

Make sure to have `node.js` and `yarn`installed and that you are in the root directory of the project, then simply run:

```bash
yarn
```

To run the development server, execute:

```bash
yarn start
```
